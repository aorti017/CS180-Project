# WhatsWeb

The current site build can be found [here](http://104.236.163.138/).
If you require any help or information on the website, look here and find the section that pertains to your need. Please read all the information to avoid any mistakes.

## Description

This website is a rendition of the popular messaging app, "WhatsApp". 
The link above will redirect you to the current live server which holds the running website.
Similar to the mobile app, this website will allow you to communicate between friends in a reliable and speedy manner. 

## Create an Acount

You have the option to create an account using Facebook, or simply create an account for the website all on it's own.

> With Facebook

To link, and create an account with Facebook, click the `Log In` button with the Facebook symbol, underneath the `Register` button.
This will redirect you to Facebook in order to gain permission for the website.
The website will not post anything to your Facebook profile, it will simply take the basic information, such as name, age, profile picture, email, and gender. 
The benefit of signing up with Facebook allows you to have a profile picture, as users who do not sign up with Facebook will not have a picture on their profile.

> Without Facebook

To create an account without Facebook, click the large blue button that reads `Register` underneath the `Submit` button on the home page. 
By doing so, you will be directed to create an account by filling in some information.
The only information necessary to create an account is a __Username__ and a __Password__. 
Be sure to choose a username you like, as you will not be able to change it later on. 
The rest of the information is optional, and you can edit it and change it later on if you like, along with your password. 
Please write down your username and password, as there is no recovery service enable at the moment, and you will not be able to access your account.

## Update/Edit Profile or Delete Account

To update your profile, delete your account, or change information, your privacy settings, and your password, first log in. 
Proceed to the `Profile` tab found on the very top right of the web page on the navigation bar.
Make sure you are on your own profile page, otherwise you have gotten lost and will not be able to edit your profile. 
If you are on your own profile page, you will see a cog, the common symbol used to settings.
Click this button, and you will be directed to a page that allows you to edit any/all of the optional settings.

> Delete Account

In order to delete your account, click the `Delete Account` button near the bottom of the page.
You will be asked to confirm you wish to delete your account, as to prevent mistakes.
By doing so, you will lose all your contacts and messages, and will no longer have an account or profile on the website.
Your friends will no longer be able to message you, and will not be able to view any of the previous interactions/messages.
Recreating your account will not bring back previous information, messages, friends, or contacts either.
This is a permanent action, please proceed with caution.

> Edit Profile

Once you have filled out or changed the information you need, click the `Update` button.
You will be redirected back to your profile page with all the new changes in affect.
If any fields are left blank, only the ones you have filled will be changed, the others will remain the same as before.
If you feel as though you no longer wish to make any changes, simply click the `Cancel` button at the bottom of the page to revert any fields you might have filled in, and will be redirected back to your profile with the information and settings as you left it.
